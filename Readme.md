% Program Name: RBCNet\_RunMe.m % Inputs: Malaria images should be
placed in the Data folder (patient input folder) % Ex:
.\Data\234C92P53ThinF\Img\IMG*20150821*150457.png %\
% Procedure: 1. Load learning models (U-Net + Faster R-CNN) % 2. Produce
segmentation mask using U-Net % 3. Detect the cells for each cluster of
blobs of the % raw image corresponding to the segmented mask from U-Net
using Faster R-CNN % 4. Filter out WBC %\
% Outputs: Store bounding boxes, scores, and visualization in the %
Output folder (patient output folder) %\
